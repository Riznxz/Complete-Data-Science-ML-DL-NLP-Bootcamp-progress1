# 🌟 My Regression Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Regression Models** learning project!  
This repository is a collection of notebooks and code that helped me understand and apply different types of regression techniques using Python.

## 📌 What is Regression?

Regression is a powerful machine learning technique used to predict a continuous value (like price, age, score, etc.). I explored different types of regression to see how models can learn patterns in data and make predictions.
